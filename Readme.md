## What is this?
This project's purpose was to learn how to use the PWA generator - GatsbyJS, while simultaneously build something fun.
You can check it out live [here](https://checkthisoutguitargod.com/). 
## What I personally like about this one
- Low-overhead posting. You just basically need to fill in frontmatter in a file and the post is ready.
- It automatically generates post thumbnails from YouTube videos.
- Responsive and good-looking on mobile devices.
- Features adjustable pagination.
- Includes SEO component.
- Search in posts.
- Nice sidebar for the menu.
- Categories and tags.
